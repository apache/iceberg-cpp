# REST catalog transport

The transport and retry properties follow the Java `HTTPClient` and
`ExponentialHttpRequestRetryStrategy`. They apply to configuration discovery,
OAuth token requests, catalog operations, and storage credential refresh requests.
Initial requests use client properties; subsequent requests use merged catalog
properties.

| Property | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rest.client.connection-timeout-ms` | 180000 | Non-negative integer; zero disables the configured deadline |
| `rest.client.socket-timeout-ms` | Unbounded | Non-negative integer; zero disables the response inactivity timeout |
| `rest.client.max-retries` | 5 | Positive integer; excludes the first attempt; does not bound total wait time |
| `rest.client.user-agent` | `iceberg-cpp/<version>` | Used when the request has no explicit `User-Agent` header |
| `rest.client.idempotency-key-lifetime` | Unbounded | ISO-8601 duration, for example `PT30M`; zero or negative durations disable keyed retries; malformed or out-of-range values are ignored |

The socket timeout measures response inactivity rather than average transfer
speed or total request duration. It does not bound request-body uploads. The
legacy `HttpClient` constructor's third argument remains a total timeout per
attempt. Transfers run synchronously in the calling thread; no executor is
required for HTTP retries.

HTTP response retries are decided after receiving the headers, before reading
the response body:

- HTTP 429, and HTTP 503 carrying `Retry-After`, permit retries for any method.
- GET, HEAD and DELETE, and requests carrying an `Idempotency-Key` header, also
  permit retries on HTTP 408, 500, 502, 503 and 504.
- Positive numeric and HTTP-date `Retry-After` values are honored. Otherwise the
  wait doubles from 1 second up to 64 seconds, with up to 10% jitter. Invalid or
  non-positive values use this backoff; numeric durations beyond the millisecond
  range saturate at the maximum representable duration.

Recoverable I/O failures before response headers are received permit retries
for idempotent methods or requests carrying `Idempotency-Key`. As in Java's
I/O-exception retry path, these retries have no delay. Name resolution,
connection, TLS, timeout, cancellation and premature-response-closure failures
are not retried. Failures while reading a final response body are propagated,
including when its HTTP status was successful.

For keyed requests, the lifetime starts at the first send. A retry is abandoned
when elapsed time plus the maximum next retry interval reaches the configured
lifetime. The bound includes `Retry-After` or the largest possible HTTP backoff
jitter. As in Java, the I/O-error lifetime check uses the exponential interval
even though the exception retry itself has no delay. Unkeyed requests are not
constrained by this property.

Authentication runs once before the first send. Retries replay the same
headers, body and idempotency key. A subsequent logical request authenticates
again and can use an updated token.

The client does not generate idempotency keys. Supply a distinct key for each
logical mutation through per-request headers or an `AuthSession`. A static
`header.Idempotency-Key` is unsuitable for unrelated mutations.

Errors are classified from the `code` reported in the error body, falling back
to the HTTP status when the body cannot be parsed. Service diagnostics remain
available. Malformed OAuth token responses never echo response content.

Other Java transport options, including `rest.client.max-connections`,
`rest.client.connections-per-route`, `rest.client.proxy.*` and
`rest.client.tls.configurer-impl`, are not yet supported by this transport.
