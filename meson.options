# Many of the options that CMake provides do not need to be implemented
# in this configuration, as Meson offers built-in support for them.
# For instance, instead of ICEBERG_BUILD_STATIC and ICEBERG_BUILD_SHARED
# you can pass the `--default_library=<option>` to the meson setup command,
# where <option> is one of "shared", "static", or "both"
#
# ICEBERG_ENABLE_ASAN / ICEBERG_ENABLE_UBSAN can be specified with
# the -Db_sanitize=address,undefined option. Starting in Meson 1.8,
# you can provide any array of sanitizers to that same argument,
# including for example the "fuzzing" option
#
# ICEBERG_INSTALL_LIBDIR / ICEBERG_INSTALL_BINDIR / ICEBERG_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR
# and ICEBERG_INSTALL_DOCDIR correspond to Meson's --libdir / --bindir /
# --includedir / --datadir arguments, respectively
